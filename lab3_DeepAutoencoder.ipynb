The algorithms are based on timing, price, quantity, and a variety of mathematical models.

    "**Stock:** A stock is a type of security that signifies ownership in a corporation and represents a claim on part of the corporation's assets and earnings.It is delivered in the units of shares.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Share:** Shares are units of ownership interest in a corporation or financial asset.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Portfolio:** A portfolio is a grouping of financial assets such as stocks, bonds and cash equivalents.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Long Position (Long):** A long (or long position) is the buying of a security such as a stock, commodity or currency with the expectation that the asset will rise in value. Trader normally has no plan to sell the security in the near future. A key component of long position investment is the ownership of the stock or bond. \n",
    "    \n",
    "**Short Position (Short):** A short (or short position), is a directional trading or investment strategy where the investor sells shares of borrowed stock in the open market. The expectation of the investor is that the price of the stock will decrease over time, at which point the investor will purchase the shares in the open market and return the shares to the broker which he borrowed them from.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Return:** A return is the gain or loss of a security in a particular period. The return consists of the income and the capital gains relative on an investment, and it is usually quoted as a percentage. The general rule is that the more risk you take, the greater the potential for higher returns and losses.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Risk:** Risk involves the chance an investment's actual return will differ from the expected return. Risk includes the possibility of losing some or all of the original investment. Different versions of risk are usually measured by calculating the standard deviation of the historical returns or average returns of a specific investment.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sharpe Ratio:** The Sharpe Ratio is a measure for calculating risk-adjusted return, and this ratio has become the industry standard for such calculations. It was developed by Nobel laureate William F. Sharpe. It is widely used to measure the performance of the strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mean Reversion:** Mean reversion is the theory suggesting that prices and returns eventually move back toward the mean or average. This mean or average can be the historical average of the price or return, or another relevant average such as the growth in the economy or the average return of an industry. \n",
    "\n",
    "A reversion involves the return of any condition back to a previous state. In cases of mean reversion, the thought is that any price that strays far from the long-term norm will again return, reverting to its understood state. The theory is focused on the reversion of only relatively extreme changes, as normal growth or other fluctuations are an expected part of the paradigm.\n",
    "\n",
    "This theory has led to many investing strategies involving the purchase or sale of stocks or other securities whose recent performances have greatly differed from their historical averages. However, a change in returns could be a sign that the company no longer has the same prospects it once did, in which case it is less likely that mean reversion will occur."

    "**Pairs Trading:** Pairs trading is a market-neutral trading strategy that matches a long position with a short position in a pair of highly correlated instruments such as two stocks. A pairs trading strategy is centered on the concept of mean reversion. It waits for weakness in the correlation, and then go long on the under-performer while simultaneously going short on the over-performer, closing the positions as the relationship returns to its statistical norm. The strategy’s profit is derived from the difference in price change (spread) between the two instruments, rather than from the direction in which each moves. Therefore, a profit can be realized if the long position goes up more than the short, or the short position goes down more than the long."

    "**Statistical Arbitrage (Stat-arb):** At a basic level, arbitrage is the process of simultaneously buying and selling the same (or equivalent) securities on different markets to take advantage of price differences and make a profit. The price differences can be the result of market inefficiencies, pricing mismatches and even currency exchange rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "In stat-arb, a profit situation arises from pricing inefficiencies between securities. Investors identify the arbitrage situation through mathematical modeling techniques. It depends heavily on the ability of market prices to return to a historical or predicted normal. A spread is formed in stat-arb to make decisions to buy or sell it according to mathematical models and statistical analysis. It is also described as complex short-term mean-reversion strategy. Pairs trading can also fall under stat-arb.\n",
    "\n",
    "Principal component analysis (PCA) is widely used as a mathematical model to create a representation of the market (model) based on a given basket of assets (i.e. stocks). An the spread between market model and the individual asset return is measured for an arbitrage opportunity. Whenever the spread is large and expected to revert back to its mean value in the near future, a trading decision is made. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, the goal is to use autoencoders (non-linear) instead of PCA (linear) to create the model for stat-arb. Detailed explanation and step by step implementation are given in Section 5.\n",

    "**Backtesting:** It is the process of testing a trading strategy on relevant historical data to ensure its viability before the trader risks any actual capital.

All of the mean-reversion based strategies rely on a mean-reverting signal to generate a trading signal. Obtaining a mean-reverting signal is not a trivial task.

On the other hand, complex algo-trading strategies like stat-arb uses complex models to obtain a mean-reverting signal for each stock in the portfolio.\n",
